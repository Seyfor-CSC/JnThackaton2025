# Introduction

You have set up an environment in Azure, but you haven't yet enabled monitoring, logging, and alerting. Since you know the basics about monitoring and logging in Azure, you've decided to gather data and learn more about these mechanisms. These challenges will guide you through the process of onboarding resources and filtering data to find what you're looking for.

## Hackathon Main Goals
- Understand Monitoring and Logging in Azure
- Understand the purpose of Log Analytics Workspace
- Be able to query and manipulate data in Log Analytics
- Create alert rules and visualization components

## Prerequisites
- You will need an Azure Subscription with the "Contributor" role assigned to enable logging in Azure environment at the subscription scope.
- You can complete this entire hack in a web browser using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).
- Consider having these tools installed on your device:
    - Microsoft PowerShell [7.5.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.5.1/PowerShell-7.5.1-win-x64.msi) with [Az module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azps-windows?view=azps-13.5.0&tabs=powershell&pivots=windows-psgallery#installation) and [update it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azps-windows?view=azps-13.5.0&tabs=powershell&pivots=windows-psgallery#update-the-az-powershell-module) to the latest version
    - Check if you have proper [Role assignments at subscription level](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal#list-role-assignments-at-a-scope)

## What You Should Know Before Starting
- The environment is prepared for you; no further deployments are needed
- You may choose to collaborate or work separately - both scenarios are covered

## Success Criteria
- All participants have correct roles assigned (at least Contributor at subscription level)
- All participants are able to log in to Microsoft Azure using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
