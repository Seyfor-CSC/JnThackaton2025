# üñ•Ô∏è Challenge 02 ‚Äì VM Insights - Magnified

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](./Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

# Introduction

After knowing the basics of Log Analytics Workspace and its functionality, basic principles of alerting and logging,
let's dive deeper into one of many solutions that Azure provides - VM Insights.

To accomplish this task, you will need to:
- Have at least 2 VMs with Contributor rights.
- Understand what is behind VM Insights.
- Have basic orientation capabilities in Azure Monitor.
- Investigate and set up some alert rules related to VM Insights.
- Understand metric namespaces and their purpose.

## Tasks
- Enable VM Insights on VM01 (incl. dependencies) and point them into Log Analytics Workspace you created in previous challenge.
- Create Alert rules related to metrics from VM Insights. Check documentation to successfully determine correct thresholds and dimensions.

### Bonus Tasks
- Enable VM Insights on VM02 (incl. dependencies), but do it in a different way than in previous step (modify one of the resources that were created during the process).
- If VM Insights are not fully functional, fix it.
- Enable VM Insights via code (PS CLI, Terraform, or PowerShell).

## Questions to think about
- What happened during the enablement of VM Insights and what resources were created?
- Is it possible now to determine capacity of specific drives within VM and why?

## Success Criteria
- Both VMs have VM Insights enabled.
- There are several alert rules related to VMs metrics.
