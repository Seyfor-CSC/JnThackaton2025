# ðŸš€ Welcome to the Azure Monitor Hackathon Challenges!

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. Whether youâ€™re new to Azure or looking to deepen your monitoring skills, these challenges are designed to guide you step-by-step through real-world scenarios using Azureâ€™s monitoring, logging, and visualization tools.

## What to Expect

Throughout these challenges, you will:
- Explore the core concepts of monitoring and observability in Azure.
- Learn how to onboard resources and enable diagnostic settings.
- Query and analyze data using Log Analytics and Kusto Query Language (KQL).
- Visualize insights with Azure Dashboards and Workbooks.
- Set up alerting and automation to proactively manage your environment.

## Who Should Participate

These challenges are suitable for:
- Developers, IT Pros, and Cloud Engineers interested in Azure monitoring.
- Hackathon participants seeking hands-on experience.
- Anyone who wants to master Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and related tools.

## How to Use These Challenges

- Each challenge builds on the previous one, but you can also tackle them independently.
- Use the Azure Portal, Cloud Shell, and your favorite code editor.
- Collaborate with your team or work solo - both approaches are supported.

## How to Use the Environment

- RG t1-infra-mon-hack-rg - This resource group is used for infrastructure that we want to monitor.
- RG t1-shd-hack-rg - This resource group is used for the shared resources that you will create during challenges (e.g., Alerts, Dashboards, Workbooks, etc.).
- RG t1-hackathon-node-rg01 - This resource group is used for the AKS. To this resource group, never add any resources.

Letâ€™s get started and unlock the full power of Azure Monitor!
